Currently, I have included sample implementation codes for three parallel approaches. These include : dynamic thresholding, flicker detection, and adaptation from traffic lights. 
All approaches are based and modelled from credible research journals. 
Upon provision of exact specifications, related to the LEDs and the industrial panel the code for preferred approach can be modified.
